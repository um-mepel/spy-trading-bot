   Conclusion: Threshold 0.65 is optimal across all stocks
               Higher thresholds (0.75+) too restrictive
               Lower thresholds (0.60) slightly worse than 0.65

COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS TESTING
================================================================================

Previous Cross-Dataset Test Results:
  SPY 2025:       21.64% return, 15 trades, -18.13% max drawdown, Sharpe 1.10
  MSFT 2024:      22.24% return, 22 trades, -0.02% max drawdown, Sharpe 1.71

Multi-Stock Test (Optimal Threshold 0.65):
  Average Return: 7.41% (much lower)
  Average B&H: 8.44%
  Average Sharpe: 6.75 (higher - better risk-adjusted)
  Average Drawdown: -0.65%
  Avg Trades: 4.91

Why the Difference?
  • Previous tests used synthetic data with optimized parameters
  • Different volatility profiles across 11 stocks
  • 0.65 threshold is compromise across all stocks
  • Some stocks (AMZN, CAT) are strong uptrends where strategy struggles

================================================================================
STRATEGIC INSIGHTS
================================================================================

1. MARKET-ADAPTIVE THRESHOLDS
   • No single threshold optimal for all stocks
   • 0.65 is good compromise but not perfect for all
   • Could implement dynamic thresholds per sector:
     - High-growth tech: 0.60-0.65 (benefit from momentum)
     - Defensive healthcare: 0.65-0.70 (more selective)
     - Cyclicals/industrial: 0.60-0.65 (trend followers)

2. WHEN STRATEGY EXCELS
   ✓ Down/declining markets (BA example)
   ✓ Low-momentum markets (JNJ example)
   ✓ Sideways consolidation (WMT example)
   ✓ Volatile but stable markets (GOOGL example)
   
   Purpose: Acts as a volatility dampener and momentum filter

3. WHEN STRATEGY STRUGGLES
   ✗ Strong sustained uptrends (AMZN +25%, CAT +18%)
   ✗ Momentum stocks accelerating (MSFT, JPM)
   ✗ Trending markets above MA50
   
   Issue: Confidence threshold too strict during momentum

4. RISK MANAGEMENT SUCCESS
   ✓ All tests showed < 1% max drawdown (excellent)
   ✓ Consistent across volatile and stable markets
   ✓ Protective in declining markets
   ✓ No catastrophic losses
   
   Conclusion: Risk management is the strategy's strength

5. SECTOR-SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE
   
   Healthcare (Best Risk-Adjusted):
     - Sharpe Ratio 7.90 (highest)
     - Outperformance +2.79% on average
     - Works well in non-trending markets
   
   Technology (Good Overall):
     - Sharpe Ratio 5.81
     - Mixed results (GOOGL, AAPL good; MSFT underperforms)
     - Works better in stable/consolidating
   
   Finance (Highest Sharpe, Mixed Returns):
     - Sharpe Ratio 7.73
     - Return 9.20% but B&H 16.49%
     - Good risk management, misses upside
   
   Industrial (Best Relative Performance):
     - Outperformance +3.36% vs B&H
     - Excellent in downturns (BA example)
     - Good sector for strategy deployment

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DEPLOYMENT
================================================================================

FOR OPTIMAL RESULTS:

1. Use Confidence Threshold: 0.65
   • Best average return (7.41%)
   • Best average Sharpe (6.75)
   • Most consistent across sectors

2. Target Market Conditions:
   ✓ Consolidating/sideways markets
   ✓ Defensive/healthcare stocks
   ✓ Declining/volatile markets
   ✓ Stocks with lower momentum
   
3. Avoid or De-Risk:
   ✗ Strong trending markets (reduce leverage)
   ✗ Momentum stocks (increase threshold)
   ✗ Aggressive growth stocks
   ✗ Consecutive positive weeks

4. Portfolio Construction:
   • Combine with trend-following strategy for momentum
   • Use in down-market hedging strategy
   • Combine with equal-weight index for stability
   • Implement as volatility-dampening component

5. Implementation Strategy:
   
   Sector-Based Approach:
   • Healthcare: 0.65 threshold, full leverage (best risk-adjusted)
   • Technology: 0.65 threshold, reduced leverage (mixed results)
   • Finance: 0.70 threshold, normal leverage (miss upside less)
   • Industrial: 0.60 threshold, full leverage (good relative performance)
   • Consumer: 0.65 threshold, normal leverage
   
   Market Regime Approach:
   • Bull Market: Reduce position size, increase threshold
   • Bear Market: Increase position size, lower threshold
   • Sideways: Normal parameters
   • High Volatility: Keep threshold at 0.65+
